Nix Flake Configuration
==============================

*"I just love when things are made for me."*

My personal flake-based configuration for NixOS and Home Manager.
This is setup with a modular directory structure for managing multiple
hosts and user environments. This separates system-wide and user configs,
with reusable modules for each.

Mantained by @[zhyie](https://github.com/zhyie)

Specifically for:
- personal preferences
- daily driving and workflow
- family home desktop
